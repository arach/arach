## 5. Human authenticity (1-5)

Does it sound like a person wrote it, or an AI performing humanity?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Could have been written by a specific person. Has voice, opinion, lived experience. Reader senses the author's personality. |
| 4 | Sounds human. Clear perspective. Minor generic patches. |
| 3 | Clean but anonymous. No glaring AI tells, but no personality either. Could be anyone. |
| 2 | Generic tone. Multiple AI patterns. Corporate-neutral. No first person, no specificity. |
| 1 | Obvious AI. Performative emphasis, binary contrasts, dramatic fragmentation. Significance inflation, promotional language, chatbot artifacts. |

**Red flags (AI tells):** "Full stop." Stacked short sentences for effect. Rhetorical questions answered immediately. Significance inflation. Promotional language. Superficial -ing analyses. Vague attributions. Copula avoidance. Communication artifacts.

**Red flags (soulless):** No opinions stated. No first person. Every claim hedged. Uniform sentence rhythm. No specific names, numbers, or dates. Balanced-to-a-fault framing.
