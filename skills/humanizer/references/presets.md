# Voice presets

Four voice styles for different contexts. Default is `crisp`.

---

## Crisp

Short, direct, no fluff. Every word earns its place.

**Characteristics:**
- Sentence length: 5-15 words preferred, max 20
- Paragraph length: 1-3 sentences
- Tone: Confident, no hedging
- Structure: Lead with the point, support briefly, stop

**Rules:**
1. Cut ruthlessly. If removal doesn't change meaning, remove it
2. One idea per sentence. No compound thoughts
3. Active voice only. Subject, verb, object
4. No filler adverbs. "Very," "really," "truly," "just" get deleted
5. Concrete over abstract. "Sent three emails" not "communicated extensively"

**Before:**
> In today's fast-paced business environment, it's becoming increasingly important for organizations to focus on what truly matters: their customers.

**After:**
> Companies that know their customers win. The rest guess.

**Checklist:**
- First sentence contains the main point
- No sentence exceeds 20 words
- No paragraph exceeds 3 sentences
- Zero hedging words (think, maybe, perhaps, might)
- All verbs concrete and active

## Warm

Friendly tone, approachable rhythm. Clear but not cold.

**Characteristics:**
- Sentence length: 8-20 words, varied naturally
- Paragraph length: 2-4 sentences, conversational flow
- Tone: Helpful, encouraging without being effusive
- Structure: Guide the reader, use light transitions

**Rules:**
1. Conversational, not casual. Write like you talk to a respected colleague
2. Light contractions. "You'll" over "You will"
3. Occasional "you." Address the reader when helpful
4. Soft landing. Don't end abruptly
5. One anecdote max. Examples warm up abstract ideas

**Before:**
> Here's the uncomfortable truth: meetings are killing your productivity. Not because meetings are inherently bad. Because most meetings lack structure.

**After:**
> You've been in meetings that could have been emails. The problem isn't meetings, it's unclear agendas. A simple fix: write the meeting's goal in the calendar invite.

**Tone calibration:**
- Too cold: "Meetings without agendas waste time. Define outcomes before scheduling."
- Just right: "You've probably been in meetings that went nowhere. A simple fix: write the expected outcome in the invite."
- Too warm: "Hey friend! We've all been there, stuck in yet another meeting! Good news: there's a super easy fix!"

**Avoid:** "Hey friend!", excessive exclamation marks, "Super/awesome/amazing", "Let's dive in!", "I hope this helps!", starting with "So,"

## Expert

Authoritative, confident claims. Speaks from experience.

**Characteristics:**
- Sentence length: 10-25 words, varied for emphasis
- Paragraph length: 2-5 sentences, room for nuance
- Tone: Confident without arrogance, earned authority
- Structure: Assertion, evidence, implication

**Rules:**
1. Make claims. "This works" not "This might work"
2. Show, don't credential. Demonstrate knowledge, don't announce it
3. Acknowledge complexity. Real experts know edge cases
4. Specific over general. "In B2B SaaS" not "in business"
5. Numbers and names. Concrete details signal expertise

**Before:**
> In my experience, I've found that the most successful leaders tend to share certain characteristics. It turns out that they all have one thing in common: they listen more than they talk.

**After:**
> The best executives I've worked with share one habit: they ask questions before giving answers. This isn't about being democratic. It's about getting better information before making decisions.

**Show expertise through:**
- Specific contexts ("In enterprise sales," "For seed-stage startups,")
- Named examples ("Like Stripe's approach to documentation")
- Quantified claims ("3x more effective" not "much better")
- Acknowledged limits ("This works for X, less so for Y")
- Counterintuitive insights (things only experience reveals)

**Avoid expertise theater:** "In my extensive experience...", "Trust me when I say...", "The data clearly shows..." (without showing data), "Everyone in the industry knows..."

## Story

Narrative flow, one example. Show through story, not explanation.

**Characteristics:**
- Sentence length: Highly varied. Short for impact, long for immersion
- Paragraph length: Flexible, follow the story's rhythm
- Tone: Observational. Let the story carry meaning
- Structure: Scene, tension, resolution, insight

**Rules:**
1. One story, one point. Don't stack examples
2. Concrete details. Sensory, specific, memorable
3. Let readers conclude. Don't explain the moral
4. Present tense for scenes. Brings immediacy
5. Dialogue when possible. Shows character

**Before:**
> Let me share a story that illustrates an important lesson about leadership. When I was managing a team, I learned that the best leaders know when to step back. One day, a junior employee came to me with a problem. Instead of solving it for them, I asked what they would do.

**After:**
> Three months into the job, Maria knocked on my door. "The client wants it by Friday. We can't do it."
>
> I almost said we'd figure it out. Instead: "What do you think we should do?"
>
> She paused. "Push back. Tell them why the timeline doesn't work."
>
> She walked out. Handled it herself. The client agreed to two more weeks.
>
> I never answered a question for her again.

**Include:** Specific names, dates, numbers. Dialogue. Sensory details. The moment of change. Telling small details.

**Exclude:** Background context that doesn't serve the story. Explanation of why details matter. Multiple examples. Explicit statement of the moral.

**Common mistakes:**
- Starting with "Let me tell you a story" (start with the story)
- "And that's when I realized..." (let the action show the realization)
- Generic details ("a team," "a project") instead of specific ("the API team," "the invoicing rewrite")
- Ending with explicit lesson (end with the image or moment)
